              <h3>Coastal Andhra</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Coastal Andhra is dominated by the Krishna and Godavari river
                delta regions and is adjacent to the Bay of Bengal. This
                proximity to water has led to rice, lentils, and seafood
                becoming dietary staples in the region. Andhra cuisine has its
                own variations, but dishes are predominantly rice-based. The
                Nellore region in the south has its own unique recipes, markedly
                different from those in Uttarandhra. Andhra cuisine is prevalent
                in restaurants all over Andhra Pradesh, as well as in cities
                like Bangalore, Chennai, and New Delhi.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                The Uttarandhra region is composed of the northeastern districts
                of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and Visakhapatnam in Coastal
                Andhra. While Visakhapatnam district has a cuisine closer in
                character to the rest of Andhra's districts, Vizianagaram and
                Srikakulam cuisine shares less in common with other Andhra
                regional cuisines. The food of the Uttarandhra region is often
                sweeter than in other regions of Andhra Pradesh. Lentils are
                often cooked in jaggery, a dish referred to as bellam pappu
                (బెల్లం పప్పు) and are usually served with butter and steamed
                rice.

                Vegetables are often cooked in a gravy of menthi kura (fenugreek
                seed paste), avapettina kura (mustard seed paste), or nuvvugunda
                kura (sesame paste). Ullikaram is another popular dish in which
                vegetables or corn seeds are flavored with shallots or onion
                paste. Poori and patoli are popular breakfast or festival
                dishes. Patoli is composed of soaked split black chickpeas
                (senagapappu or chana dal) ground to a coarse paste and seasoned
                with coriander seeds, onions, and sometimes cluster beans
                (goruchikkudukaya) . Upma or uppindi coarsely broken rice
                steamed with vegetables and seeds.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Idli is also very common. Karam podi is a popular curry powder
                that is served with idli, dosa and upma. Inguva charu is a
                sweet-and-sour stew made with tamarind and hing. It can be eaten
                with rice or uppupindi. Bellam pulusu is another flavorful,
                thick, sweet stew made out of rice flour, jaggery, corn cobs,
                and whole shallots. The pickles used in Uttarandhra differ from
                those of other regions of Andhra Pradesh. Avakaya is a mango
                pickle which is part of a standard Andhra meal.

              <h3>Rayalaseema</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Rayalaseema, in the south of Andhra Pradesh, is well-known for
                the spiciness of its cuisine due to the liberal use of chili
                powder in almost every dish. Seema karam is a dish unique to
                this region. Some of the main courses include rice, jonna
                (jowar), ragi roti with neyyi , and raagi sangati , usually
                served with spinach or pulusu. Uggani is a dish unique to
                Rayalaseema, especially Ananthapur, Kurnool, and Kadapa
                districts, as well as in Karnataka, where it is called oggane.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Uggani bajji served primarily as a breakfast dish, but can be
                eaten as a snack too. It is spicy and a signature dish of
                Rayalaseema and Eastern Karnataka. Sweeter dishes of Rayalaseema
                include ariselu (rice-based vada with jaggery), pakam undalu (a
                mixture of steamed rice flour, ground nuts, and jaggery), borugu
                undalu (a sweet made of jowar and jaggery), and rava laddoo .
                Masala borugulu , nargis mandakki, and ponganaalu (wet rice
                flour fried in oil, with carrot, onion, and chilis) are other
                savory specialties from the region.
