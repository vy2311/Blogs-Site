                Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in
                taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a perfect blend
                of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in
                India has also been influenced by various civilizations, which
                have contributed their share in its overall development and the
                present form.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                India has a rich culinary heritage. Indian cuisine has a
                <strong><em>5000-year-old history</em></strong
                >. Mythological beliefs and traditions have played an important
                role in its evolution and development. The main Indian food was
                based on Hinduism but the Islamic influence during the Mughal
                era, the Persian exchanges with the Middle East and the British
                colonial system have all contributed immensely towards laying
                the foundation of the Indian cuisine.

                India is a big country with many states and regions. Each region
                offers a unique assortment of dishes and cooking techniques.
                Each regional cuisine uses its own locally grown herbs, spices,
                fruits and vegetables. These regional cuisines collectively
                combined together form the very delightful Indian Cuisine.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                The staple Indian foods are Rice, Wheat and Lentils. And no
                Indian dish is complete without spices. Indian food is a
                combination of all six tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter,
                spicy and astringent. In India different dishes are prepared for
                different festivals. Every festival tends to be complete only
                when special food associated with that festival is cooked on
                that day. Like Holi can not be complete without Gujhiya and Eid
                without Sewai. India is the only country in the world where
                there is Unity in Diversity not only its culture & religion but
                also its cuisine.

                In western India, the desert cuisine is famous for its unique
                taste and varieties of food. Rajasthan and Gujarat are the
                states that represent the desseert flavor of Indian food. Here
                an immense variety of dals and achars (pickles/preserves) is
                used that simply substitutes the relative lack of fresh
                vegetables in these areas. East Indian Food Sandesh In the
                eastern India, the Bengali and Assamese styles of cooking are
                noticeable. The staple food of Bengalis is the yummy combination
                of rice and fish. Usually the Bengalis love eating varieties of
                fishes. A special way of preparing the delicacy known as ‘Hilsa‘
                is by wrapping it in the pumpkin leaf and then cooking it.
                Another unusual ingredient that is commonly used in the Bengali
                cooking is the ‘Bamboo Shoot’. Various sweets prepared in this
                region, by using milk include the ‘Roshogollas‘, ‘Sandesh‘,
                ‘Cham-cham‘ and many more.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                In the southern India, the states make great use of spices,
                fishes and coconuts, as most of them have coastal kitchens. In
                the foods of Tamil Nadu use of tamarind is frequently made in
                order to impart sourness to the dishes. It simply distinguishes
                the Tamil Food from other cuisines. The cooking style of Andhra
                Pradesh is supposed to make excessive use of chilies, which is
                obviously to improve the taste of the dishes. In Kerala, some of
                the delicious dishes are thelamb stew and appams, Malabar fried
                prawns, Idlis, Dosas, fish molie and rice puttu. Another famous
                item of this region is the sweetened coconut milk. Yet another
                dish is Puttu, which is glutinous rice powder steamed like a
                pudding in a bamboo shoot.

                Foods of India are better known for its spiciness. Throughout
                India, be it North India or South India, spices are used
                generously in food. But one must not forget that every single
                spice used in Indian dishes carries some or the other
                nutritional as well as medicinal properties. Food in the north
                India, to begin with, Kashmiri cuisines reflect strong Central
                Asian influences. In Kashmir, mostly all the dishes are prepared
                around the main course of rice found abundantly in the beautiful
                valley. Another delicious item cooked here is the ‘Saag‘ that is
                prepared with a green leafy vegetable known as the ‘Hak‘.

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                But on the other hand states like the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar
                Pradesh show high consumption of chapatis as staple food. Again,
                these chapatis are prepared with a variety of flours such as
                wheat, rice, maida, besan etc. Besides chapatis other closely
                related breads baked in these regions include Tandoori, Rumaali
                and Naan etc. However in the northern region impact of Mughlai
                food is quite obvious.
