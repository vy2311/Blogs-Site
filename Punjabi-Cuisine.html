              <h3>History</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the
                agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of
                the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to
                tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan
                civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the
                archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for
                a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan
                civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found
                ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the
                tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been
                unearthed.Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars
                which was used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta
                Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after
                marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and
                fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven
                structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern
                tandoors of the Punjab.

              <h3>Style of Cooking</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                There are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many
                people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for
                cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens.
                Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of
                cooking involves use of the tandoor.In India, tandoori cooking
                is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the
                tandoor on a regional level.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the
                1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi.
                According to Planalp (1971), "the Panjab-style underground oven
                known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi"
                pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab,
                it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called
                Kath tandoors in Punjabi.

              <h3>Staple foods</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Punjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products.
                These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people.
                The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy
                products in India.Therefore, dairy products form an important
                component of Punjabi diet. Dairy products are a staple in
                Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are
                popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to
                make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional
                Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                raditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's
                yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk.
                Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare
                Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side
                dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of
                Lassi. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also
                the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified
                butter).
