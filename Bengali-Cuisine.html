              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Bengali cuisine (Bengali: বাঙালি রন্ধনপ্রণালী) is the culinary
                style of Bengal, that comprises Bangladesh and the Indian states
                of West Bengal and Tripura.The cuisine has been shaped by the
                region's diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied
                use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of
                its confectioneries and desserts.There is a strong emphasis on
                rice as a staple, with fish traditionally the most common
                protein.

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although barramundi,
                known as bhetki, is also common. Meat is also a common protein
                among Bengalis with chicken and mutton meat being the most
                popular. Beef is popular within the muslim community. In more
                recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of
                the diet. Many Bengali food traditions draw from social
                activities, such as adda, Poila Boishakh, Eid feast.

              <h3>Culinary influences</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Muslims conquered Bengal around the mid-thirteenth century,
                bringing with them Persian and Arabic cuisine.[6] Such dishes as
                biryani, korma and bhuna had once been meals of the higher
                courts, but the cooks of the Mughals brought their recipes to
                the lower and middle classes.[7] The influence was reinforced
                during the rule of the British Raj, where Kolkata became the
                place of refuge for many prominent exiled Nawabs, notably the
                family of Tipu Sultan from Mysore and Wajid Ali Shah, the ousted
                Nawab of Awadh.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and masalchis
                (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth
                diminished, they became interspersed into the local population.
                These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of
                spices (most notably jafran and mace), the extensive use of
                ghee, and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.[8] Catla
                kalia Catla kalia Mutton chaap In Bangladesh, this food has
                become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they
                have remained the food of professional chefs

              <h3>Regional specialties</h3>
              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                Different parts of Bengal are famed for certain dishes, food
                items and ingredients. For example, South Bengali districts
                around the Sundarbans boast of the expensive chui jhal chilli,
                which they peel and chop into small pieces to be cooked in their
                dishes and give off a strong aroma. On the other hand, North
                Bengal are the homes of many Bengali desserts such as the Mishti
                doi of Bogra, the Kachagolla of Natore and the Chomchom of
                Porabari.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-5 fw-light text-secondary">
                However, other regions also have famous desserts like the Balish
                Mishti (pillow-sweet) of Netrokona, the Monda of Muktagachha,
                the Red Yoghurt of Nabadwip and the famed Roshmolai of Comilla.
                Chittagonian Bengali Cuisine (Mezban & Kala bhuna) Chittagonian
                culinary tradition is mostly known for Mezban and mixed rice
                dishes like kala bhuna, which has shoulder pieces of beef and
                traditional spices. Dried fish (shutki) is more available in the
                Chittagong region than in other parts of Bengal.[15]
